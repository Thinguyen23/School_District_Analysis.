# School_District_Analysis.
In this analysis, I helped Maria conduct a study on the school district which include

- An overview of the key metrics for each school (per_school_summary_df)
- Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate (top_schools.head() and bottom_schools.head())
- The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school (math_scores_by_grade)
- The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school (reading_scores_by_grade)
- School performance based on the budget per student (spending_summary_df)
- School performance based on the school size (size_summary_df)
- School performance based on the type of school (type_summary_df)


## Challenge
After removing the reading and math scores, answer the following questions:

- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does removing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?
- How does removing the ninth-grade scores affect the Math and Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type?
